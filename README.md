Welcome to the [Susasan Design System](https://sanphebagar.susasan.org) brought to you by [YoungInnovations](https://www.younginovations.com.np).

Since we’ll have to display a lot of data in each of SUSASAN’s component, the designs are carefully crafted so that the information is not overwhelming to the user. The designs have a personality and represent the SUSASAN brand. However, they do not distract the user away from the main content and act as a medium to communicate information in an organic manner. The most important information are displayed at the top and with higher visibility while less important ones are given comparatively low preference.
